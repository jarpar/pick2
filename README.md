# Pick Two
Small [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) app which generates a "pick two" mechanism. 

E.g. when it comes to the software, you always have to choose two out of:
- _fast_ 
- _cheap_
- _good_

If something is _fast_ and _cheap_ at the same time, it just cannot be _good_. And so on and so forth.

## Usage
Share the URL [`https://mat3e.github.io/pick2?first=fast&second=cheap&third=good`](https://mat3e.github.io/pick2?first=fast&second=cheap&third=good) where `first`, `second` and `third` parameter values can be modified. 

You can also use the `title` parameter to change 'Pick two' header into something else.

**Protip:** use `+` for a whitespace.

## Libraries
- [pretty checkbox](https://lokesh-coder.github.io/pretty-checkbox/)

## (possible) Follow-ups
- custom switch web component
   - it took me too much time to find something like that, so I finally used just the mentioned CSS lib
