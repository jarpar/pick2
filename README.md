# Pick Two
Small [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) app which generates "pick two" mechanism. E.g. when it comes to the software, you always have to choose two out of: _fast_, _cheap_ and _good_. If something is _fast_ and _cheap_ at the same time, it just cannot be _good_ and so on and so forth.

## Usage
Provide someone the URL `https://mat3e.github.io/pick2?first=fast&second=cheap&third=good` where `first`, `second` and `third` values can be modified.

Use `'+'` instead of whitespaces.

## Libraries
- [pretty checkbox](https://lokesh-coder.github.io/pretty-checkbox/)

## (possible) follow-ups
- custom switch web component (would like to create this, because it took to much time to find sth)
